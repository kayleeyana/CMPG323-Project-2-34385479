# Microsoft Azure database
1. Started off by creating an account on Microsft Azure.
2. Created a Monthly budget to avoid running out of credits.
3. Created a resource group called rgEcoPowerSolutions.
4. Created a SQL server and database under the resource group rgEcoPowerSolutions.
5. Opened SSMS and connected to the database.
6. Then added it under a SQL database and hosted my database there.
7. I then added tables to the database via Sql Server Management Studio (SSMS).
